## Automated Testing Commands

```bash
# Build and validate
npm run build

# Start development server
npm run serve

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Serve and test
./dev.sh test
```

## Manual Testing Steps

1. **Initial Setup**

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run serve
   ```

2. **Open Browser**

   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
   - Verify page loads without errors

3. **Test File Selection**

   - Click "Select Configuration Files"
   - Navigate to `samples/` folder
   - Select both `app-config.json` and `server-config.xml`
   - Verify both files appear in editors

4. **Test Form Interaction**

   - Modify various field types
   - Toggle checkboxes
   - Edit number inputs
   - Modify text fields
   - Edit array JSON

5. **Test Saving**

   - Click save for each file
   - Verify success messages
   - Check that original files are updated

6. **Test Error Handling**
   - Try invalid JSON in array fields
   - Test with malformed files
   - Verify error messages appear
