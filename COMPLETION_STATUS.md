- ✅ `.config` files are parsed as JSON format
- ✅ Full integration with existing form generation system

### 2. **File Persistence**

- ✅ Files persist when browser is closed/refreshed
- ✅ Uses localStorage with metadata storage
- ✅ Graceful handling of File System Access API limitations
- ✅ Version compatibility checking

### 3. **Additive File Selection**

- ✅ New files are added to existing selection
- ✅ Duplicate files are filtered out automatically
- ✅ Existing files remain open when adding more
- ✅ Success messages for newly added files

### 4. **Remove File Functionality**

- ✅ Confirmation dialogs before removal
- ✅ Proper cleanup of storage and UI
- ✅ Success messages after removal

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Quick Test Steps:

1. **Open the app**: http://localhost:8081
2. **Load sample files**: Click "Open Configuration Files" and select files from `/samples/`
3. **Test .config support**: Load `samples/app.config`
4. **Test additive selection**: Load more files without losing existing ones
5. **Test removal**: Use × buttons to remove files
6. **Test persistence**: Refresh browser to verify files remain loaded
7. **Test editing**: Modify form values and save changes

### Sample Files Available:

- `samples/app-config.json` - JSON configuration
- `samples/app.config` - Config file (JSON format)
- `samples/server-config.xml` - XML configuration

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The application maintains **SOLID principles** with clean separation of concerns:

- **FileHandler**: Manages file selection and type detection
- **Parsers**: Handle JSON, XML, and Config file parsing
- **Renderer**: Generates dynamic forms and handles UI
- **Persistence**: Manages file saving via File System Access API
- **StorageService**: Handles browser storage for persistence
- **Main App**: Orchestrates all components

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **File Handle Persistence**: Due to browser security, file handles cannot be fully persisted. The app stores metadata and attempts to restore access when possible.

2. **Browser Support**: Requires modern browsers with File System Access API support (Chrome 86+, Edge 86+).

3. **Storage Size**: localStorage has size limitations (~5-10MB depending on browser).

## 🔄 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- **Undo/Redo functionality** for file edits
- **File comparison** to show changes before saving
- **Export/Import** configurations as backup
- **Advanced validation** for configuration schemas
- **Theme customization** options

## 🎯 Ready for Production

The application is **fully functional** and ready for:

- ✅ Local development and testing
- ✅ Deployment to static hosting (GitHub Pages configured)
- ✅ Extension with additional file formats
- ✅ Integration into larger workflows
